Test Assesment Report

This was a triumph.
I'm making a note here:
HUGE SUCCESS.
It's hard to overstate
my satisfaction.
Aperture Science
We do what we must
because we can.
For the good of all of us.
Except the ones who are dead.

But there's no sense crying
over every mistake.
You just keep on trying
till you run out of cake.
And the Science gets done.
And you make a neat gun.
For the people who are
still alive.

Personnel File Addendum:

Dear <<Subject Name Here>>:

I'm not even angry.
I'm being so sincere right now.
Even though you broke my heart.
And killed me.
And tore me to pieces.
And threw every piece into a fire.
As they burned it hurt because
I was so happy for you!
Now these points of data
make a beautiful line.
And we're out of beta.
We're releasing on time.
So I'm GLaD. I got burned.
Think of all the things we learned
for the people who are
still alive.

One last thing:

Go ahead and leave me.
I think I prefer to stay inside.
Maybe you'll find someone else
to help you.
Maybe Black Mesa...
THAT WAS A JOKE, HA HA, FAT CHANCE.
Anyway this cake is great
It's so delicious and moist
Look at me still talking 
when there's Science to do
When I look out there
it makes me GLaD I'm not you
I've experiments to run
There is research to be done
On the people who are
still alive.


PS: And believe me I am 
still alive
PPS: I'm doing science and I'm 
still alive
PPPS: I feel FANTASTIC and I'm 
still alive

FINAL THOUGHT:
While you're dying I'll be 
still alive

FINAL THOUGHT PS:
And when you're dead I will be still alive
still alive.

STILL ALIVE
